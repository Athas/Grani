Grani - hackable Webkit-based browser
==================================

Grani is yet another relatively simple browser based on Webkit with an
emphasis on using external tools for most everything (such as the UI).

This program started as a fork of the [Surf][surf] web browser by the
Suckless project.


Requirements
------------

In order to build Grani you need GTK+ and Webkit/GTK+ header files.  To
use it, you need [Sindre][sindre].


Installation
------------

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (Grani is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install Grani (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install
